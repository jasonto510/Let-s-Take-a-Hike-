##Development
This web application was designed to encourage users to find trails near them. I created a homepage with hiking facts and a section for users to enter in their location to find a specified number of trails(default 10) and distance(default 10 miles) near a specific longitude and latitude. Afterwards, users are given a choice to save the trail in their local Mongo Database and/or view the single location or all of the locations saved in their database. After designing this portion, I created a section for new or experienced hikers to create a list of gear needed for upcoming hikes.

##Installing Dependencies
