  stayingDry : ["To stay dry while hiking be sure to carry a good quality, fully waterproof rain jacket and rain pants. Fully waterproof clothes have a breathable liner and seam sealed zips. If they don’t have these two features, it’s water resistant not waterproof.", "It’s also important to keep your backpack dry so you don’t arrive to camp with wet clothes and a wet sleeping bag.", "I recommend putting your sleeping bag in a dry bag and using a pack cover (which fits around you backpack). Another option is to use a pack liner, which is a bag that you first put in your backpack then pack everything inside that bag."]
